Hi, I'm Chang! I've been working as a data professional in a variety of roles: from business and product analytics to modeling and data engineering.

Outside of work, I enjoy landscape photography - check out **[my portfolio](https://photography.changsun.com/)** for some of my work.

I also have a personal Substack that I sporadically post to. For now, it'll mostly consist of links to interesting things I've read lately.
