Hi, I'm Chang! I've been working as a data professional in a variety of roles: from business and product analytics to modeling and data engineering. I'm also currently working towards a part-time MS in Computer Science through Georgia Tech's OMSCS program. Beyond data and CS, I enjoy reading and learning about a wide range of subjects: international relations and geopolitics, history, urbanism and city planning, chess, and much more.

## Photography
Outside of work, I enjoy landscape photography, and will often bring my Fuji X-T20 with me on most hikes or trips I take. You can find my work on my [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/changrybirds), or on my [portfolio site](https://photography.changsun.com/).

## Substack writing
I also have a [personal Substack](https://internetpoints.substack.com/) that I sporadically post to. Right now, it serves as a way to link to interesting things I've read lately. This is mostly for the benefit of my friends, who are probably tired of me link-spamming in our group chats. It will also force me to become more thoughtful and deliberate in my reading.

## This blog
This site will host any of my more structured writing. As such, new posts will be relatively infrequent.
